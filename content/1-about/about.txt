Title: About

Text: 

My travels have taken me from Pittsburgh to Detroit to Austin and now to Eugene. I've worked at agencies, web shops, software and data companies that served enterprise, small business, education, and automotive customers.

On the side, along with a couple other people, I have built mobile apps and successful job-search applications. 

[My full résumé is here.](/resume/)

Outside of software, my primary jobs are Dad and Husband. I also play music and produce recordings for other small artists and bands.
