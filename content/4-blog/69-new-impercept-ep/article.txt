Title: New Impercept EP

----

Text: I spent a lot of time a couple months back experimenting with the new version of Reaktor. It doesn't actually work on my studio computer because it requires Yosemite, so it was something I could handle while at home on my newer Macbook Air (which runs Reaktor surprisingly well). For a cover and the title, I blasphemed the only (link: https://parvulusinfectus.bandcamp.com/album/the-mark-ov-force-unspoken text: Parvulus Infectus album) released while we were together. It's maybe inspired by Bowie's cover for *The Next Day*.

Have a listen, and maybe like (link: http://facebook.com/impercept text: Impercept on Facebook) for more of my musical experiments that don't logically fit with one of my bands.
