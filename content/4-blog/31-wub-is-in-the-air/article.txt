Title: Wub is in the air

----

Text: This weekend I was buying cables in Guitar Center and they had just the most terrible sounds going in the pro audio department, maybe even worse than the sounds that are always coming out of the guitar department.

It was a fairly generic female singer doing some kind of singer-songwriter, almost-pop ballad stuff, but over the most obnoxious Skrillex-style American dubstep.

I like James Blake but I just can’t imagine anything more incongruous than the blaring wub-wub with the mellow vocals, it’s like a DJ randomly mixing two records with no regard to content.

Does anyone have any idea what this is so I can avoid it in the future?
