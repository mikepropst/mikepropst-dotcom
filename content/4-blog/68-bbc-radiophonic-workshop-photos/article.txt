Title: Photos from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop

----

Text: Really cool pictures, mostly from the 60s but some even earlier, of the place where the BBC employed practitioners of hard core experimental electronics to make commercial sound. There's Delia Darbyshire, Daphne Oram, an EMS Synthi 100, and all kinds of tape loops hanging everywhere. So cool.
