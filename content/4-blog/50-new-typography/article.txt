Title: New Typography

----

Text: I've updated the type on the site. Maybe do a hard refresh if you're so inclined. I won't be getting to a redesign any time soon, but I wanted to make things a little more reasonable. Things are now set in Merriweather and Merriweather Sans, which I think are great little fonts.
