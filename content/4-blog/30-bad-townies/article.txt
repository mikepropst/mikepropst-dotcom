Title: Bad townies

----

Text: On the way to work this morning, I heard Op Ivy's "Bad Town," and I realized two things:

1. It is objectively the worst song on *Energy*.
2. Tim Armstrong's obsession with both rap and violence, which came to a head with the Transplants, is nothing new.

Not going anywhere with that, just a thought...

Summary: Oh, Tim.
