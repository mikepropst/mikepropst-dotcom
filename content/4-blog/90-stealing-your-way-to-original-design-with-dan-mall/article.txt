Title: Stealing your way to original design with Dan Mall

----

Text: 

Mall is a capable, arguably influential designer and writer on the web. It's always cool to see how the sausage is made, but even cooler to see that a person with his credentials has (link: http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/ text: a framework) for creative "theft" as a basis for starting new designs. 

When you're experienced, you start to internalize these kinds of layout patterns. But while recently working on a website, I realized I hadn't designed one in a very long time and was pretty unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of a site these days. This would've been a great way to get rolling, and I might try it for the next iteration.
