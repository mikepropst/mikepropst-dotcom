Artist: The Nouns

Role: Recording, Mixing

Description: A unique recording challenge for this Eugene/Portland-based hip hop and jazz quintet. The Nouns wanted to record audio at an intimate live performance in front of an audience that would also be shot on video. In one of the most complex routing jobs I've had to do on the fly, I miked everything up then took the singer, MC, and saxophone (keys and bass had amps) back out of the computer through zero-latency monitoring into the PA. I had a very usable multitrack recording when it was all over, and mixed that back at my downtown Eugene studio.
