Description: A very interesting transcontinental project for a Russian metal/hardcore band in the vein of Tragedy. We recorded drums in Eugene, OR to a click track. The Pro Tools session was shipped via Dropbox to Moscow, where guitars, bass, and vocals were overdubbed in a studio there and sent back to me for mixing. The band's preferred sound was more lo-fidelity than we'd initially captured, so I had to "dirty" it up a bit to give it the oppressive, cavelike atmosphere of vintage black metal.
