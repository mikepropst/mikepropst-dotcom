Projecttitle: Summer Moon

Artist: You Might Think We're Sharks

----

Role: Recording, Mixing, Production

----

Description: From the same session as "Firecracker," I decided a couple years after the fact to go back and overdub guitars and harmony vocals over the live tracks. We only had a scratch vocal, but it was quite good, so I polished it up and used my own voice to complement the singer's.

Othercreds: Written by Daniel Monnich. Recorded with Sean McGee.
