Role: Recording, Mixing, Production

Description: My current own band. An instrumental hybrid of dark ambient and doom metal that was recorded entirely in our practice space at Space Eugene and overdubbed in my studio. We recorded raw drums to a click, overdubbed guitars, and then assembled it along with electronics entirely inside Pro Tools, working as if it were a piece of electronic music.  Also available on Spotify.
