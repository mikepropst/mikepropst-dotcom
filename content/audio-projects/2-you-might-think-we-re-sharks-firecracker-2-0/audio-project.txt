Artist: You Might Think We're Sharks

Role: Recording, Mixing, Production

Description: Recorded on location at the guitarist's house where the high ceiling, wood floors, and ample reflection surfaces made for a great drum sound. For this project the band had rented multiple Peluso vintage re-creation tube mics and a lunchbox full of Radial preamps to supplement my normal recording chain. I mixed dozens of channels of electronics along with acoustic and electric guitars, live drums, and vocals overdubbed in my own studio in Austin, TX.
