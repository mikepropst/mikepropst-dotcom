I worked with the team at HCB Health — most closely with a content strategist and creative director — to build the early wireframes for an educational material and simulation application for the iPad.

The content focused around the client's branded product, an advanced version of a shunt used in glaucoma surgery. The procedure is a low-reward, low-profit surgery that the client hoped to improve for surgeons. But the materials to educate doctors on modern procedures, not just their product, were few and far between.

In addition to working with the HCB team, this work involved close communication and frequent checkins with the client.
