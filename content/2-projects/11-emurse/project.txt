Text: 

Emurse was a popular tool built by Humidity Labs (and eventually sold) that let job seekers both passive and active build and host their résumés online. It gave users a dedicated web space for one or more résumés, a set of professional looking pre-built themes, and the ability to download them in a large number of formats including PDF and Word.

The résumés were built using a dynamic tool and saved as structured data instead of a blob of text the way Monster (the only real competitor at the time) did, which allowed employers to target job seekers more granularly and effectively.

*Note: Designs shown are from version 2, which was visually re-built by a different designer. The UX and color palette remained largely unchanged.*
