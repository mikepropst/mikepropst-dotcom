Title: Colophon

### Layout
This site is built using the ubiquitous but ultimately very useful [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). I used the LESS version of Bootstrap, because LESS is very handy and it helped me enjoy front end development more than I have in years. The menu uses a hamburger, even though the jury is very much out still. By the time the jury comes back, the hamburger will be even more omnipresent and this problem may have been solved.

### Type
The body is set in Lato, the headings Slabo, both available through Google Fonts. 

### CMS
The content is managed by the outstanding and incredibly simple [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com), about which I can't say enough great and rad things.

### Misc
Other tools used include [Rhodia pads](http://rhodiapads.com/), Grunt, [CodeKit](http://incident57.com), Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, and a Canon EOS T3i.

I'm sure that's more than you wanted to know. Thanks for looking.
